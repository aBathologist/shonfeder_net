## [Synechepedia](https://shonfeder.github.io/index.html): A digital (sketch|scrap|note)book

- Drawing connections, fumbling for expression, taking note 
- Full of rough drafts, works in progress, and evocative snippets I've read

## [Coding Made Easy at IS 62 K (Ditmas)](https://www.newyorkcares.org/projects/coding-made-easy-62-k-ditmas-7): Education in programmatic literacy

- A [New York Cares](https://www.newyorkcares.org/) project partnered with the
after-school program at Ditmas Junior High.
- Over 14 weeks, we supported students exploring basic programming
concepts, techniques, and technologies
- I helped launch this project as a Volunteer Team Leader, coordinating the
volunteers, tailoring the curriculum to the needs of each student, and providing
hands-on instruction and support in the classroom on a weekly basis.

## [/r/prolog](https://www.reddit.com/r/prolog): The logic programming subreddit

- Moderator and contributor for more than 6 years

## [/r/futurebeats](https://www.reddit.com/r/futurebeats): Omnigeneric haven for experimental beat music

- I founded the subreddit, established its core ethos and norms, and recruited the
initial team of moderators. I was heavily involved in supporting and nurturing
the community for several years. A group of active and talented moderators and
contributors have built up a small, but vibrant online ecosystem with this
subreddit at its center. I continue to moderate and contribute to the community
at a low frequency.
- Currently home to a community of nearly 100k subscribers
- Something like a musical genera has formed with this community near to its
  center
