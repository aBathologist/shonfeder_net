<div id="bio">

I study philosophy and programming. 

I am concerned for the wellbeing of the disadvantaged and for humanity's future.

I am seeking ways to use what I learn from my studies in order to care for my
concerns.

I have been studying philosophy in and out of academia for 17 years. My recent
studies focus on the philosophy of logic, the philosophy of mathematics,
phenomenology, semiotics, and the foundations of analytic philosophy.
I have also studied German idealism, critical theory, literary theory,
philosophy of language, and early modern philosophy.

I have been studying programming independently for three years. My study of
programming languages has focused on the declarative paradigms of logic
programming, functional programming, and constraint programming, though I have
not entirely neglected imperative languages. I am also actively studying type
theory and its computational applications as well as the general theory of
computation. I have recently begun studying ways to make myself more marketable.
