<div id="bio">

I study philosophy and computer programming. 

I am concerned for the well-being of the disadvantaged and for humanity's future.

I am working to apply what I learn from my studies to benefit those for whom I
am concerned.

I have been studying philosophy in and out of academia for 17 years. My recent
studies focus on the philosophy of logic, the philosophy of mathematics, the
Kantian critical system, semiotics, and the foundations of analytic philosophy.
I have also studied German idealism, critical theory, phenomenology, literary
theory, philosophy of language, and early modern philosophy.

I have been studying programming independently for five years. My study of
programming languages has focused on the declarative paradigms of logic
programming, functional programming, and constraint programming, though I have
not entirely neglected imperative languages. I am also actively studying type
theory and its computational applications as well as the general theory of
computation. I have recently begun studying ways to make myself more marketable.

## Projects

### Coding Made Easy at IS 62 K (Ditmas)

[Coding Made Easy at IS 62 K](https://www.newyorkcares.org/projects/coding-made-easy-62-k-ditmas-7)
is a [New York Cares](https://www.newyorkcares.org/) project partnered with the
after-school program at Ditmas Junior High. We provide students with tutoring
and guidance on basic programming concepts, techniques, and technologies in a
relaxed, fun environment. I helped launch this project in my capacity as the New
York Cares Volunteer Team Leader. I coordinate the volunteers, tailor the
curriculum to the needs of each individual student, and provide hands on
instruction and support on a weekly basis. The kids we work with are the
sweetest you'll ever meet, and the project could always use more volunteers!

### tokenize.pl

[tokenize.pl](https://github.com/aBathologist/tokenize) is a simple Prolog
tokenization utility. It provides a straightforward, and very limited, tool for
the simple tokenization of text.

### protelog.pl

[protelog.pl](https://github.com/aBathologist/protelog) is an experimental
library of Prolog syntax extensions, It is under irregular but ongoing
development.

### sml-utils

[sml-utils](https://github.com/aBathologist/sml-utils) is an ongoing project. It
is comprised of Standard ML modules (compatible with
[SML/NJ](http://www.smlnj.org)) facilitating functionality that I have found
useful or interesting during the course of my experiments with, and studies of,
SML.

### /r/prolog

I am a moderator of, and frequent contributor to,
[/r/prolog](https://www.reddit.com/r/prolog). The subreddit is dedicated to logic
programming generally, but it is dominated by slow motion discussions of Prolog.
At the moment, the bulk of our activity focuses on helping beginners get acquainted
with the language and figure out their homework problems.

### /r/futurebeats

I founded [/r/futurebeats](https://www.reddit.com/r/futurebeats), establishing
the basic ethos, recruiting the initial moderators, and working out the core
norms with the earliest community members. Since then, a group of active and
talented moderators and contributers have built up a small online ecosystem,
with the subreddit at its center. I continue to moderate and contribute to the
community. Over the years, the subreddit has grown to over 60,000 subscribers
and something like a musical genre has formed in relation to it.
