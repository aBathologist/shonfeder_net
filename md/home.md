<div id="bio">

I study and practice computer programming and philosophy.

I am concerned for the well-being of the disadvantaged and for humanity's future.

I am working to apply what I learn from my studies to benefit those for whom I
am concerned.

My current work focuses on applying principles of functional programming and
type driven design to improve development, build, and release infrastructure.
Our watchwords are determinism, reliability, reproducibility, and receptivity.

My active side-projects involve writing programs in OCaml and doing research at
the intersection of programming language theory, type theory, critical
philosophy, semiotics, and cybernetics.

My studies of programming have been focused on the declarative paradigms of
[logic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming),
[functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming),
and [constraint programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_programming).

My philosophical studies have recently been focused on the philosophy of logic
(especially structuralist logic), the philosophy of mathematics (especially
early 20th c., constructivism, and category-theoretic foundations), Kant's
critical system (especially in relation to the modern axiomatic method and type
theory), semiotics (especially the work of C.S. Peirce and Goguen's work in
algebraic semiotics), and the foundations of analytic philosophy. I have also
studied German idealism, critical theory, phenomenology, literary theory,
philosophy of language, and early modern philosophy.

## Open Source Projects I've Contributed To

### Dune

[Dune](https://github.com/ocaml/dune) is "a composable build system for OCaml".
I've contributed to the design and implementation of the CLI tooling.

### ATD

[ATD](https://github.com/mjambon/atd) "stands for Adaptable Type Definitions. It
is a syntax for defining cross-language data types" written in OCaml. I extended
a small language feature.

### Eliom

[Eliom](https://github.com/ocsigen/eliom) is an OCaml framework for
client/server web apps. I've helped correct and improve some documentation.

### Vyconf

[Vyconf](https://github.com/vyos/vyconf) is a software appliance configuration
framework written in OCaml and under development in connection with the network
operating system [VyOS](https://vyos.io/). I contributed to the
code that parses the VyOS configuration language.

## Projects

A few of these projects are completed. Several are dormant (but not dead).
Several are still under active development.

### My Synechepedia

[My Synechepedia](https://shonfeder.github.io/index.html) is a
scrapbook/log/personal-wiki/homepage collecting notes, ideas, plans, excerpts
and records of my activities.

### Consolate

[Consolate](https://github.com/shonfeder/consolate) is an ongoing (but paused)
experiment in the modular design of modal console applications, written in OCaml.

### Coding Made Easy at IS 62 K (Ditmas)

[Coding Made Easy at IS 62 K](https://www.newyorkcares.org/projects/coding-made-easy-62-k-ditmas-7)
was a [New York Cares](https://www.newyorkcares.org/) project partnered with the
after-school program at Ditmas Junior High. Over the course of 14 weeks, we
provided students with tutoring and guidance on basic programming concepts,
techniques, and technologies in a relaxed and fun environment. I helped launch
this project in my capacity as a New York Cares Volunteer Team Leader. I
coordinated the volunteers, tailored the curriculum to the needs of each
individual student, and provided hands-on instruction and support on a weekly
basis.

### tokenize.pl

[tokenize.pl](https://github.com/aBathologist/tokenize) is a simple Prolog
tokenization utility. It provides a straightforward, and very limited, tool for
the tokenization of text. `tokenize.pl` is [available as a package](http://www.swi-prolog.org/pack/list?p=tokenize)
from the standard SWI-Prolog package repository.

### protelog.pl

[protelog.pl](https://github.com/aBathologist/protelog) is an experimental
library of Prolog syntax extensions, It is under irregular but ongoing
development.

### sml-utils

[sml-utils](https://github.com/aBathologist/sml-utils) is an ongoing project. It
is comprised of Standard ML modules (compatible with
[SML/NJ](http://www.smlnj.org)) facilitating functionality that I have found
useful or interesting during the course of my experiments with, and studies of,
SML.

### The tilde.town web ring

I was an active participant in the early days of
[tilde.town](http://tilde.town/) and wrote most of the code for the
[tilde.town web ring](https://github.com/aBathologist/tildetown_ring).

### /r/prolog

I am a moderator of, and frequent contributor to,
[/r/prolog](https://www.reddit.com/r/prolog). The subreddit is dedicated to logic
programming generally, but it is dominated by slow motion discussions of Prolog.
At the moment, the bulk of our activity focuses on helping beginners get acquainted
with the language and figure out their homework problems.

### /r/futurebeats

I founded [/r/futurebeats](https://www.reddit.com/r/futurebeats), establishing
the basic ethos, recruiting the initial moderators, and working out the core
norms with the earliest community members. Since then, a group of active and
talented moderators and contributers have built up a small online ecosystem,
with this subreddit at its center. I continue to moderate and contribute to the
community. Over the years, the subreddit has grown to over 60,000 subscribers
and something like a musical genre has formed in relation to it.
